# Welcome to the A-frame Gulp.js Tutorial


# Getting Started

First we are going to install gulp and the helper libraries for it.

Create a Node.Js Project

``` npm init ```

This will create a ``` package.json``` file

Install Gulp.js  

```
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install gulp -D
```

Next we install helper libraries for Gulp

``` npm install --save-dev gulp-jshint gulp-concat gulp-uglify gulp-rename gulp-connect ```

We are also going to install browserify to build it to web

``` npm install --save-dev gulp-browserify ```

Actually install Aframe.

We should finally actually install aframe

``` npm install --save aframe ```

# Creating our build setup
